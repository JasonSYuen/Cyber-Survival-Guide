              <p4> <strong>Phishing</strong><br> </p4>
<p4>-Phishing is when a hacker sends emails/texts pretending to be somebody or some organization asking for personal information.<br></p4>
<p4>-Email Phishing - where people mimic emails from popular organizations like Paypal, asking you to click a link or give sensitive information.<br></p4>
<p4>-Spear Phishing - Sending malicious emails knowing certain information, but requesting others (for example, knowing job name, place of employment or requesting passwords).<br></p4>
<p4>-Whaling - It’s particular towards senior executives requesting items like Tax Returns with hoards of information.<br></p4>
<p4>-Angler Phishing - It attacks through social media, using private messages, posts, tweets.<br></p4>
              <p4><br></p4>
              <p4><strong>Bad Downloads</strong><br> </p4>
<p4>-Downloads that seem safe on the surface. They may include video games, programs, or even virus protection software. However, once you download them, a hacker can have access to your device and steal whatever they want.<br> </p4>
              <p4><br></p4>
              
              <p4><strong>Fake Lottery </strong><br> </p4>
<p4>-these can come from emails, text messages, and calls, that simply say that you won a prize or that you are a lucky winner. If the user is unaware of these scams, they can appear authentic, as they use real brands and fake reviews. These prizes will ask for addresses and credit card information, or simply ask for you to log in again before seeing the prizes. Once you give them your credentials, they can gain access to your accounts/computer.<br></p4>

              <p4> <br></p4>
              <p4><strong>Fake Survey</strong><br></p4>
<p4>-Similarly to the “win a prize” scam, fake surveys will show up in emails, asking to fill out a survey for a variety of topics. The surveys may ask for the user’s name and address and other personal information in order to steal your data.<br></p4>

              <p4><p4> <strong>Misspelled words</strong><br></p4>
              <p4> <br></p4>
              <p4> <strong>Paying via gift cards/prepaid debit cards</strong><br></p4>
              <p4> <br></p4>
              <p4> <strong>Asking for personal information</strong><br></p4>
              <p4> <br></p4>
              <p4> <strong>Too good to be true</strong><br></p4>
              <p4>-If it feels like you are getting significantly more value in this exchange than the person giving the offer, chances are it could be a scam. Trust your gut.<br></p4>
              <p4> <br></p4>
              <p4> <strong>False URLs</strong><br></p4>
              <p4>-Many scams will use real company names and websites, and it may be hard to see if the website is authentic or not. One way to see is the url, or the link inside the search bar. If the link contains way too many additional items in it besides the “website.com”, it could be a scam. (Additional items meaning random letters and numbers)<br></p4>
              <p4> <br></p4>
              <p4> <strong>Asking for extremely sensitive information (Tax returns, SSN)</strong><br></p4></p4>

              <p4> <strong>Back up important documents</strong><br> </p4>
<p4>-Backing up documents can be as simple as having documents printed, although this is not recommended. Better alternatives are to download these documents onto a hard drive or upload to the cloud (Google Drive is a good example)<br></p4>
              <p4><br></p4>
              <p4><strong>Download trusted antivirus</strong><br> </p4>
<p4>-Although scams can come in the form of antivirus software, there are some that can be trusted. All it takes is some light research to find which software is the best.<br> </p4>
              <p4><br></p4>
              
              <p4><strong>Use a VPN</strong><br> </p4>
<p4>VPN’s are a bit more advanced compared to the other options, but are very effective. They mask your information from any hackers and trackers, and can even make them think your device is in a separate location. It should be noted that VPN’s cost money, and any “free” ones either do not work or are also scams.<br></p4>

              <p4> <br></p4>
              <p4><strong>Avoid sharing personal information</strong><br></p4>
              <p4><br></p4>
              <p4><strong>Choose secure passcodes/ use different passcodes for different things</strong><br></p4>
              <p4><br></p4>
              <p4><strong>Buy from trusted websites like Amazon, Best Buy, etc.</strong><br></p4>
              <p4><br></p4>
              <p4><strong>Use two factor authentication</strong><br></p4>
              <p4>Two factor authentication is just a fancy phrase that means sending a code to your phone or email to use as an additional login to your password. It simply adds another layer of protection to your information.<br></p4>
              <p4><br></p4>
              <p4><strong>Only go on known wifi networks, not public</strong><br></p4>
              <p4><br></p4>
              <p4><strong>Don't ask people you only met online in person to meet at your home</strong><br></p4>
